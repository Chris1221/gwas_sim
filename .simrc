# This is the configuration or runtime commands (rc) file for the simulation.
#
# In this file, variables are specified which relate to various aspects of the simulation. 
#	If you are intereted or need to edit the variables, please look in the makefile and see where they are used. 
#	A partial explaination will be given in the comments.
#
#	Variables will follow the shell naming conventions.
#	i.e. upper case and spaces replaced by underscores.
#
#	Please note that all variables must be able to be read by the shell
#	which means that there should be no spaces on either side of =
#		For example: 
#			EX=10 is correct
#		Versus
#			EX = 10 is incorrect



# General variable declarations.

# Here we decide the platform being used and use our best guess to use the correct
# binary image.
#
# You may also replace this whole thing with 
#	 hapgen2="path_to_your_binary"
# et cetra.
#
# N.B. It is preferable here to use the absolute adress of your binary
# 	if you are inputing it yourself.
#
# Also none of this will work in windows, but you probably already knew that.

### Leave this for now, but come back later.
#	Something about a missing seperator. 
#	I think make is having a hard time reading bash functions.
